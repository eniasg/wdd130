                <h1>How I Work</h1>
                <p>Step 1 - I will visit your premise, and we enjoy a hot chocolate together, while I get to understand your business and plans for the future. During the initial meeting, I will take high quality, professional images if they are not already available.</p>
                <p>Step 2 - I will develop a wireframe to show how items will be laid on the web pages. When needed, I will help with content creation. It is also the right time to start thinking of a domain and getting it set with a web hosting company. When domain and hosting is set, I will help you create organization or domain emails.</p>
                <p>Step 3 - Designing and development starts soon after wireframe/s approval.</p>
                <p>Step 4 - Demo website presentation either at your site or mine. Any changes will be done before the final step of going live.</p>
                <p>Step 5 - Going live and you start enjoying the boosting of your services and business growth.</p>
                <p>Extra step will be training. I will develop a user manual and train you on how to update and add content (including images) to keep your website up to date and remain relevant.</p>

            <h2>My Skills</h2>
            <p>I am a Brigham Young University student pursuing a degree in Applied Technology. Technology fascinates me and have developed an interest ever since I was introduced to computers in the early 90s. Skills - At BYU am learning the latest and more advanced technologies that we can take advantage of and use for our benefit. I have been thinking of making an impact in my community here in Aspindale and have taken this opportunity to use my web solution skills to help improve our community business environment. Applications I have worked with â€“ Python, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, XML, CSS, C++, WordPress, Drupal, ASP.Net, Java, C#, SQL</p>
