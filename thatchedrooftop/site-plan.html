        Content

      <h3>Home page</h3>

      <p>Let’s build your website</p>
      <p>Do you have a business in and around Aspindale community? Do you have a service you are offering and advertising by word of mouth? Do you want to create an online presence to inform the Aspindale community of events, meetings or sharing your baking skills online? You have many online ideas and don’t know where to start and how to do it.</p> 
      <p>An answer to all your web needs has emerged within your community. I am ready to work with start-ups, small to medium enterprises and individuals in turning your ideas into reality, that will help grow your services and business using modern technology. I will not leave you alone from day one. I will hold your hand throughout the entire process of creating your online presence to maintaining it and making sure your website is safe and always up to date.</p>
      <p>Your website will be responsive – means that your website will render well on larger screen (desktops) and handheld devices (mobile phones and tablets). I design and develop responsive websites that will automatically adjust for different screen sizes. I will code your website to get better search engine ranking by implementing proper use of search engine optimization (SEO) techniques.</p>
      
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>How I Work</h3>
      <p>Step 1 - I will visit your premise, and we enjoy a hot chocolate together, while I get to understand your business and plans for the future. During the initial meeting, I will take high quality, professional images if they are not already available.
        Step 2 - I will develop a wireframe to show how items will be laid on the web pages. When needed, I will help with content creation. It is also the right time to start thinking of a domain and getting it set with a web hosting company. When domain and hosting is set, I will help you create organization or domain emails.
        Step 3 - Designing and development starts soon after wireframe/s approval.
        Step 4 - Demo website presentation either at your site or mine. Any changes will be done before the final step of going live.
        Step 5 - Going live and you start enjoying the boosting of your services and business growth.
        Extra step will be training. I will develop a user manual and train you on how to update and add content (including images) to keep your website up to date and remain relevant.</p>
